Description:
This project is an assignment for CPSC 486 for Michael Shafae. The original repository is under teapot_vision-master.

The assignment is to have the camera show which objects are visible in the view frustrum. In the original repository, all objects were considered visible. While this isn't noticeable in the default camera- as it can only show off the objects in view, when switched to the bird's eye view camera, it shows that every object is considered "visible".

In order to change the visibility of each object, we need to compare the object's position if it is in the view frustrum. There are two matrices used to figure this out: the lookAtMatrix that originates from the camera and represents the birds-eye view camera, and the clipPlaneMatrix, which is the view frustrum. We need to project the object's position to the lookAtMatrix- which is to say that we need to have the object's position relative to the lookAtMatrix, or entire view. At that point, we then project that position to the clipPlaneMatrix, comparing the object's position in the entire plane to the object's position in relation to the view frustum. At that point, we can then check if the object is in the view frustum. Mathematically we compare the x,y, and z coordinates of the teapot's position (which is now in relation from the plane of the entire view to the camera's view) to it's w value. if all three values are "within" the w value (between the negative and the positive value of w), then it is considered visible. Otherwise it is not considered visible. In both the original and the modified code, the visible value is shown as the object is red if it is visible, and white if it is not. When this is compiled and executed, in the bird's-eye view camera, it should have the objects in the camera's view frustum as red and everything else as white.
